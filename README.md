# IoT_Platform
### Todo before v0.1:
- [X] Add config files for clients
- [X] Add optional capabilities (capability 'turn on' should only be available if device is in state 'off')
- [X] Add custom capabilities, using strings instead of an enum
- [X] Add ability to hand client callback functions to be called when certain capabilities are triggered
- [ ] Write a proper README
- [ ] Get client working on a Raspberry Pi
