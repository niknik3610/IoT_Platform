# Client Library for Nik's Open-source Smart Home Platform 
This Rust library is meant as a resource to easily write code to interact with the [NOSHP server](https://github.com/niknik3610/IoT_Platform). This is mainly meant for Smart-Home devices.

### Notes
- At the moment you will need to have the protobuf compiler installed (instructions can be found [here](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/)), I will try to get rid of this dependency in the future
